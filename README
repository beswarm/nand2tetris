My self learning notes  on  nand2tetris.
The projects folder will keep trace of the working progress of mine.

Many thanks to Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, creators of the project. 
The nand2tetris project's  homepage is http://www.nand2tetris.org. 
It's really a fantastic  learning material for those who seek to understand how computer works.
